## Introduction
- an overview of what the project does
- your inspiration for making the project 
- examples that it is based on. 

Adidas and Nike shoe products have been popular with consumers for many years and some popular products can be priced at thousands of dollars. However, in recent years consumers have faced the risk of potentially buying fake shoes. Identifying fake shoes with the naked eye is still risky and costly, so could automatic identification with high accuracy be accomplished if deep learning and AI technology were used?
The first thing needs to do before identifying the authenticity of shoes is to identify the brand and type  of the shoes.
So the aim of our project is to train a classification model by using neural network based embedded AI to classify the brand of the shoes in the images.As the time limited here we only classify Adidas and Nike shoes. There will be the potential real-world applications of the project, such as in the field of e-commerce or product authentication.
In this project, we tried two different sources of data as training sets for separate experiments:1) sxistent Adidas and Nike shoes images downloaded from Google images; 2)real-world shoes images taken using a camera carried by Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.   

*Tip: probably ~200 words and images are good!*

## Research Question
Can we build an embedded artificial intelligence project based on neural networks to identify whether the brand of shoes is Nike or Adidas?

What is the problem you are trying to solve

*Tip: probably 1 or 2 sentences*

## Application Overview
Thinking back to the various application diagrams you have seen through the module - how would you describe an overview of the building blocks of your project - how do they connect, what do the component parts include.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to convey your design!*

## Data
Describe what data sources you have used and any cleaning, wrangling or organising you have done. Including some examples of the data helps others understand what you have been working with.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and images of what the data 'looks like' are good!*

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!*

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results? 

*Tip: probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!*

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?  

*Tip: probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!*
